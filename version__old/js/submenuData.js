        Galvan Lopez<br><br><br>
        

        Fullstack Web Developer with a strong passion for design, known for my organized and structured approach. My journey into web development has been shaped by a unique blend of experiences in architecture, design, and technology.<br>
        I spent three years immersed in architecture school, where I developed a deep appreciation for structure, aesthetics, and problem-solving. This foundation was further enriched by a year in a design school, followed by another year specializing in game design and development. These diverse experiences laid the groundwork for my true passion: creating clean, functional, and visually appealing digital solutions.<br>
        My most significant milestone came during my time at O'clock School, where I honed my skills as a fullstack web developer. Here, I mastered the art of writing clean, efficient, and maintainable codeâ€”a reflection of my innate organizational skills and my belief that well-structured code is the backbone of great development.<br><br>
        
        While I strive for a balanced expertise in both front-end and back-end development, my heart leans towards design and the front-end. I love crafting user experiences that are not only functional but also visually engaging.<br>
        My work is driven by a desire to blend creativity with technical precision, ensuring that every project I undertake reflects both beauty and practicality.<br><br>
        
        Beyond my passion for web development, sports have always been a big part of my life. I've always been an energetic and active person, participating in various sports across different disciplines. I have played team sports such as handball and rugby, as well as water sports like surfing and windsurfing. Additionally, I have a strong love for snow sports, especially skiing and snowboarding, and I have also practiced athletics independently.<br><br>

        Languages have also played a crucial role in my personal growth. I have been learning English since I was a child. In high school, I chose to study French, expanding my linguistic abilities. Beyond formal education, I have had the privilege of traveling extensively across Europe and North America, immersing myself in different cultures and practicing languages. I even spent many summers living with foreign families to further improve my language skills. These experiences shaped my global perspective and adaptability.<br>
        In 2018, I took my international experience a step further by living in London, England, and since 2023, I have been residing in Paris, France. These moves have reinforced my passion for cultural exchange and communication, making me not only a developer with a strong technical and creative foundation but also a global citizen eager to learn and grow.<br><br>
