        <p>Galvan Lopez<br><br><br>Fullstack Web Developer with a strong passion for design, known for my organized and structured approach. My journey into web development has been shaped by a unique blend of experiences in architecture, design, and technology.<br>I spent three years immersed in architecture school, where I developed a deep appreciation for structure, aesthetics, and problem-solving. This foundation was further enriched by a year in a design school, followed by another year specializing in game design and development. These diverse experiences laid the groundwork for my true passion: creating clean, functional, and visually appealing digital solutions.<br>My most significant milestone came during my time at O'clock School, where I honed my skills as a fullstack web developer. Here, I mastered the art of writing clean, efficient, and maintainable codeâ€”a reflection of my innate organizational skills and my belief that well-structured code is the backbone of great development.<br><br>While I strive for a balanced expertise in both front-end and back-end development, my heart leans towards design and the front-end. I love crafting user experiences that are not only functional but also visually engaging.<br>My work is driven by a desire to blend creativity with technical precision, ensuring that every project I undertake reflects both beauty and practicality.</p>
